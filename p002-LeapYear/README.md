Leap Year
---------

Create a program that prompts the user to enter a year and then determines whether the year is a leap year.

A year is a leap year if it is 
	1) divisible by 4 but not by 100, OR 
	2) is divisible by 400.

2003 is NOT a leap year  
  
enter a year: 2000  
2000 IS a leap year  
  
enter a year 2012
2012 IS a leap year
