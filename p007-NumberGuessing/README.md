Number Guessing
---------------

Write a program that generates a number (between 1 and N) that the user must then guess. After each guess, the program says whether the guess was too high, too low, or correct.


### example ###
enter the maximum number: 20  
Guess a number between 1 and 20  
next guess: 4  
4 is too low  
next guess: 15  
15 is too high  
next guess: 12  
12 is too high  
next guess: 8  
8 is too high  
next guess: 5  
5 is too low  
next guess: 7  
You got it in 6 guesses! 

### example ###
enter the maximum number: 100  
Guess a number between 1 and 100  
next guess: 25  
25 is too high  
next guess: 10  
10 is too low  
next guess: 15  
15 is too low  
next guess: 18  
18 is too low  
next guess: 23  
23 is too high  
next guess: 21  
21 is too high  
next guess: 20  
You got it in 7 guesses!
