Palindrome Tester
-----------------

Write a program that reads lines from a text file and tests whether each is a palindrome, ignoring letter case, whitespace, and punctuation.

### example ###
Testing string: Never odd or even
--> this string IS a palindrome

Testing string: This is probably not a palindrome.
--> this string IS NOT a palindrome

Testing string: Doc Note: I dissent. A fast never prevents a fatness. I diet on cod.
--> this string IS a palindrome

Testing string: Sums are not set as a test on Erasmus
--> this string IS a palindrome

Testing string: Again, a palindrome, this is not!
--> this string IS NOT a palindrome

Testing string: Madam, in Eden I'm Adam
--> this string IS a palindrome
