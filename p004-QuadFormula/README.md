Quadratric Formula
------------------

The user enters the three coefficients of a quadratic equation, and the program uses the quadratic formula to calculate the root(s) of the equation.

### example ###  
The quadratic formula finds the root(s)  
where f(x) = 0 of the quadratic equation  
f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c  
  
Enter the coefficients of your equation  
a: 1  
b: 6  
c: 8  
Two real roots: -2.0 and -4.0
